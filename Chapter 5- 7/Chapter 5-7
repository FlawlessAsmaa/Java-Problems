1- if (x > 0 && x < 10) {
             System.out.println("positive single digit number.");
         }

2-  the output will be 
Just for
Any not more
itâ€˜s breakfast!

4- public class HelloWorld{

first thing to be executed is : else {
System.out.println("ik");
baffle(quince);
System.out.println("boo-wa-ha-ha");
}
}



 Second thing to be executed is : System.out.println(blimp);

Value of blimp is rattle
The output of this program is : 
           ik
           rattle
           ping zoop
           boo-wa-ha-ha
